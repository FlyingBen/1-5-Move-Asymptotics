# 1-5-Move-Asymptotics

This repository consists all necessary files to compute and analyze 1-5 move spinfoam aplitudes. We sampled our data using "Monte Carlo Sampling.nb" and data analysis is done in "DataPlot.nb". There are three zip files corresponding to the fixed line probe, divergence related to the close to null tetrahedron, divergence related to the distribution of volume. Each zip file contains all the boundary data used in the paper and amplitude computation files. The rar files contain two large set of sample data.
